### Gameplay:
Each player controls a tank. (Player 1 controls the green tank, Player 2
controls the red tank, Player 3 controls the blue tank, and Player 4 controls
the yellow tank.)

In a stock match, players are given a set number of lives. The goal is to be the
last remaining player.

In a time match, players are given a fixed amount of time in which to accrue
points. At the end of the time match, the player with the highest score wins.

In a score match, players attempt to be the first to reach a target score. The
first player to reach the target score wins.

Each tank has a finite number of bullets which it may fire at a given time. This
number is specified below each player's score, in the "B:" field of the
scoreboard. Bullets bounce a finite number of times upon impacting a wall before
they explode. This number is specified below each player's score, in the "O:"
field of the scoreboard. The final number in the scoreboard, in the "S:" field,
indicates the speed of the player's tank.

Containers spawn randomly throughout the playing field. Shooting these
containers reveals a power-up, which the player can collect by driving their
tank over it. Power-ups are one of an extra bullet, an extra bounce, or extra
tank speed. The maximum number of bullets is 5, the maximum number of bounces
for each bullet is 3, and the maximum tank speed is 3.
