The Landships Committee is a game of retro tank combat for up to four players.
Players navigate their tank around the map, attempting to destroy enemy players'
tanks.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
---

The Lanships Committee currently runs only on Windows PCs, though a build is
forthcoming for Mac OS X and for Linux. (Realistically, the game works currently
on these platforms, but the build itself needs a little more polishing.) System
requirements for The Landships Committee are as follows:

CPU: Intel Core i3 or comparable
GPU: Intel HD 3000 Graphics or comparable
RAM: 2GB
Storage: 25MB of available storage
Input: 2 to 4 Xbox 360/Xbox One or Playstation 4 DualShock 4 controllers

The game may run acceptably on computers with CPUs which do not meet the minimum
specifications, but have a discrete GPU -- the requirements listed above assume
the use of an integrated graphics chipset, and the majority of Core 2 Duo iGPUs
are often not sufficient. Your mileage may vary; these are mostly guidelines
rather than hard requirements. Nothing is going to stop you from running the
game on a machine which does not meet these requirements, so feel free to tweak
your configuration as necessary if the game's performance is marginal.

Controllers are actually required to play the game; there is no keyboard and
mouse control scheme for The Landships Committee. Any XInput compatible gamepad
(i.e. Xbox 360 or Xbox One compatible controllers) should work as expected; the
game also supports PlayStation 4 DualShock 4 controllers. Xbox and PlayStation
controllers can be mixed and matched, so if you have a combination of
controllers for each console, feel free to use both. Wired and Wireless gamepads
should both work fine as long as they are recognized as gamepads by the
operating system.

Unrecognized gamepads will be treated as Xbox controllers, so if their button
mapping is not the same, they will behave erratically.

More controller mappings and support will be added in the future; for now,
assume that only Xbox and PlayStation 4 controllers are supported.


GAMEPLAY
---

The Landships Committee will display a prompt for players to confirm that they
wish to play in each round; a prompt is displayed for each controller connected,
up to four players. Players will press A on an Xbox controller, or X on a
PlayStation 4 controller to confirm that they are ready to play. Maps are listed
down the right-hand side of the screen, by name, and are selected using up and
down on the thumbstick or the directional pad. When all players are ready, and a
map has been selected, press start on an Xbox controller, or Options on a
PlayStation 4 controller to move to the next screen.

Game options allow players to select the type of match they wish to play, and
the settings for that match type. Available match types follow:

Stock match - Players start with a finite number of lives. The last player
              standing wins.
Score match - The game is played until a player achieves the specified number of
              points. It is worth noting that destroying your own tank results
	      in the loss of a point, and scores can become negative.
Time match  - The game is played for a specified number of seconds. The player
              with the highest (or least negative) score at the end of this time
	      is the winner.

Pressing Start or Options on this screen will begin the match.

In-game controls are listed when starting the game; a simple explanation
follows:

Left thumbstick  - Move your tank. Press the thumbstick in the direction you
                   wish to move in, and the tank will automatically rotate to
		   face that direction.
Right thumbstick - Aim your tank's turret. Press the thumbstick in the direction
		   you wish to aim, and the turret will automatically rotate to
		   face that direction.
Right trigger    - Fire your tank's gun.

During play, power-ups may be acquired. They are listed under each player's
score, showing the current level of each power-up. Power-ups are listed left to
right, as follows:

Number of bullets - The number of bullets a given player may have on-screen at
                    a given time. Players cannot fire until they have fewer
		    bullets than this number actively on-screen. (Maximum 5)
Number of bounces - The number of times a player's bullet will bounce before
                    detonating. (Maximum 3)
Tank speed        - The relative speed of the player's tank. (Maximum 3)

Things to note during play:
 - Crates labelled with a 'P' will appear randomly throughout the map. These
   contain power-ups, which can be revealed by shooting the crate.
 - Your bullets will bounce off of walls, and off of bricks which appear shiny.
 - Your bullets will destroy you as well as enemy tanks.
 - Destroying your own tank will cause you to lose a point in score and time
   matches.
 - Bricks can be destroyed with three shots. Bricks which appear shiny will
   bounce bullets off of them; bricks which appear matte will cause bullets to
   detonate on impact.
 - Bricks will occasionally drop power-ups.
 - Purple tiles can be driven over, but shots will not pass through them.
 - Stippled gray tiles can be shot over, but not driven over.

With that said, have fun!


MAP EDITOR
---

Included with The Landships Committee is LandshipsEditor.exe, a rudimentary
level editor. This is still a work in progress, but was used to create all of
the maps which are included with The Landships Committee. Feel free to create,
play, and distribute your own maps!

Controls:

Mouse wheel - Select a tile
Left click - Place a tile
'S' - Save a map. Nothing will stop you from overwriting an existing map, so use
      caution. Type the map's name, and press 'enter' to save it.
'L' - Load a map. Attempting to load a map which does not exist will return you
      to the editor screen as it was before. Type the map's filename, and press
      'enter' to load it.

Notes:

 - In order for a map to function correctly, all four player start tiles must be
   placed. (These are the tiles which appear to be numbers 1 through 4, and are
   color-coded.) Players take up four tiles on-screen, and the start tile should
   be placed at the bottom right tile of the four.
 - Destructible bricks can be placed by placing the tiles which appear to be
   either matte or shiny white boxes at the bottom right corner of where the
   brick is to appear.
